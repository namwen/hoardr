Hoardr
======

Hoardr is a simple ruby class for backing up files to Flickr. 

Instantiate a new Hoardr object with the source, destination, and gif paths. You'll also need a Flickr API key and Secret, which you can get after creating an app [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/).

For more info on how the class works read [this blog post](http://blog.willnewman.me/hoardr).

Usage is pretty simple. Code is pretty sloppy. 

Check the sample app called "app.rb" for usage examples.
